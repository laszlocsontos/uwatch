# UWatch

### Goal

UWatch is descriptive link generator for streaming video sites (eg. YouTube). The main goal of the project is to assist users in sharing human-readable link.

### Example

Standard URLs don't hold any information about the content:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGdFHJXciAQ

Long URLs created with UWatch put videos to be shared into context:
http://focused-veld-834.appspot.com/5649391675244544/vivaldi---four-seasons--winter-

### Future improvement

* Support more video sharing sites like Vimeo, Youku, Rutube, etc.
* List most popular videos on the landing page
